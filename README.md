# Tutorial

Since ATLauncher does not seem to work at downloading curseforge mod packs we will be using Curse forge sadly.

Go to https://www.curseforge.com and download the desktop app.

After downloading the app install it.

Once everything is good there install minecraft from the app and go to settings and go to minecraft and allowcate half of your system ram to it or 3/4 of it if the game is not running as smooth.

Go to https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric/files/4380136 and hit install

After it has installed launch it and and have fun!
