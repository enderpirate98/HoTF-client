# Intro

This a guide for joining the Home of the frog world and playing in it.

everyone is expected to read and follow this guide to join, if you have any questions please read through the guide first and if you still have problems then please post them in server-problems, With all that out of the way lets begin! 

This will not work in the vanilla official Mojang approved launcher so you will have to use a modded one instead and it is very easy to setup and use.

I am assuming that you are using either ATLauncher or curseforge to run the modpack and both will be covered here.

First we will be going over ATLauncher since it is my perfered launcher but if it does not work for you for whatever reason you can try curseforge.

# Tutorial for ATLauncher!

First go to https://atlauncher.com/downloads and download the application for your OS of choice.

After is is finished double click it and install the application, go through all the prompts and restart your device after installation is complete.

Now that we have it installed we need to do a few things.

Go to the settings tab on the right, and change the default tab to Instances, click on the top tab that says "Java/Minecraft" and change the Maxium ram to half of your system ram (If not sure how much ram you have go to Task manager and click on the resources tab and do half of that in mb binary, if not sure then google it.) with all that done hit save and move to the next step.

Hit the tab that says "Account" and click the button that says sign in with microsoft account and sign in, it should tell you to close the window and move back to ATLauncher, switch the account from "Add An Account" to your account.

Go to the tab that says "Packs", then the left tab that says curseforge and search "better mc", there should be one that says "[Fabric] 1.19.2" somewhere in its name, hit the new instance button and select the version v16.5, name it whatever you want and hit install.

Launch it after installation is done and put in the server IP that is givin to Home of the frog members.

Have fun!

# Tutorial for Curseforge!

First go to https://download.curseforge.com and download for your perferred OS of choice.

After is is finished double click it and install the application, go through all the prompts and restart your device after installation is complete.

Now that we have it installed we need to do a few things.

Find minecraft and click install and hit yes for the default mod folder.

After that go to settings and go to minecraft, you will see a slider, set it to half of your system ram (If not sure how much ram you have go to Task manager and click on the resources tab and do half of that in mb binary, if not sure then google it.) With all that done hit save and move onto the next step.

Close curseforge and head to the link provided: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric/files/4430432

Hit install and it will prompt you to open curseforge, hit yes and the modpack will install itself.

Launch it after installation is done and put in the server IP that is givin to Home of the frog members.
